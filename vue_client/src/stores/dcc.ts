// Client store for the DCC download manager (#270 phase 2), for sending
// (#1086), and for the XDCC queue (#1085). Mirrors the server's dcc_transfers
// rows and backs the DCC tab of the files window: the initial list comes from
// GET /api/dcc, then live state changes arrive over the WS as `dcc-transfer`
// frames (applyTransfer). Acting on a transfer (accept / reject / cancel) goes
// over POST and the authoritative row echoes back — both through the action's
// response and, redundantly, the live frame the server publishes on the change.
//
// DCC is OFF for almost everyone (a self-host opt-in + per-user grant; dark on
// hosted cells), so the UI affordance stays hidden until the account has a
// transfer or a file. On an instance that runs DCC, both lists load with every
// snapshot (resync), so the affordance is there from the start whenever there
// is something in it; live frames keep it current.
