  // which also covers a line from someone ignored since it arrived (the server
  // only screens out who was ignored at the time), judged as the line it was,
  // in the reply's buffer. `text`: the reply's own text, without the `alice: `
  // it opens with when the quote names her — how halloy and goguma send one,
  // so clients without replies still see who it's for. Only then: with the
  // quote unavailable, that address is the only sign of who it's to.
  //
  // A quoted line from a marked relay bot (#996) shows the person inside its
  // envelope — `<alice> hi`, not `<bridgebot> <alice> hi` — as the timeline shows
  // that line. The address may name either: our Reply addresses her, a client
  // that knows nothing of relay marks (halloy, goguma) the bot. The ignore check
  // comes first and judges the line as the bot's, again as the timeline judges
  // it, so a quote never hides a line its row would show, or shows one it would
  // hide.
  //
  // ⚠ Known gap: the parent's text is the server's excerpt (REPLY_EXCERPT_MAX).
  // A custom template with literal text AFTER `{message}` can't match a line
  // cut short, so a long line from such a bot is quoted as the bot's.
