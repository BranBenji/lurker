// per device, where the pre-seam code hoisted one `const json` above the fan-out.
//
// deliver() composes `content` exactly once per push and hands that same object
// to every subscription, so keying on its identity collapses the work back to
// one serialization. A WeakMap because the entry should die with the push, not
// accumulate one string per notification ever sent.

/**
 * The delivery policy every Web Push goes out with: a 48-hour lifetime, and `high`
 * urgency for a message, which is wanted now — at `normal` a push service may hold
 * it for a sleeping phone (Android's Doze, on FCM's Web Push endpoint), and a relay
 * reads urgency as APNs/FCM priority (#1045). A came-online can wait, and
 * shouldn't wake a dozing phone every time a favorite's connection flaps.
 *
 * No `Topic`, though it would collapse a buffer's undelivered pushes into its
 * latest: Chrome's Web Push runs on FCM, which takes the topic as a collapse key
 * and keeps at most four per offline device, dropping the rest with no rule for
 * which — the reason fcmSender sends no collapse key either.
