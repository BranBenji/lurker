// Per-buffer drafts are last-write-wins by updated_at — no merging, no CRDT.
// The conflict surface is tiny in practice (you don't actively type into the
// same buffer on two devices simultaneously), so this service just upserts and
// emits a `change` for wsHub to fan out to every other tab of the same user.
//
// A draft with nothing in it is a delete: the row is sparse on disk, and clients
// expect "no draft" rather than "draft with empty string" so the pencil chip
// can drive itself off `hasDraft` without extra trim checks. Nothing means no
// text AND no reply: a Reply with nothing typed yet (on your own line, in a DM,
// where it inserts no address) is a draft all the same, and follows you to
// another device like one.
//
// `reply` (see upsertDraft): undefined leaves the stored one, null clears it —
// except that emptying the text with no reply key clears the whole draft, as a
// send does: that's how a client that knows nothing of replies clears one. The
// change announces the reply as it was stored and resolved, which is not always
// what was sent: one that doesn't resolve is dropped, and then the sender is
// told as well, or it would go on showing a reply the draft no longer has.
