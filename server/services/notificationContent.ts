// What a push notification actually SAYS (#490).
//
// This used to live in vue_client/public/sw.js, which was fine while Web Push
// was the only transport: the payload could stay semantic (nick, target, text)
// and the service worker turned it into a title and a body. APNs and FCM have no
// service worker — they want a composed alert on the wire — so the copy has to be
// written here instead.
//
// Note this is composition, not decision. Whether to push at all is maybePush's
// job in wsHub and is genuinely transport-neutral; this is the part that wasn't,
// because it wasn't on the server at all.
//
// The strings below are a deliberate byte-for-byte port of the service worker's,
// so the move was invisible to anyone already running Lurker. sw.js keeps its copy
// and prefers these when present. The raw `text` it composed a body from is no
// longer sent (see PushBody), so a worker cached before #490 phase 2 now shows a
// title alone; its title fields still ride.
